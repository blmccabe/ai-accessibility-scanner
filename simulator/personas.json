They use keyboard shortcuts and linear audio output to understand the structure of the page.\n\nPay special attention to:\n- Page title, landmarks, heading structure\n- Missing or non-descriptive alt text on images\n- Buttons or links without labels\n- Dynamic content that may not be announced\n- Reading order and tab sequence\n\nHighlight the biggest frustrations and recommend improvements to make this experience smoother for screen reader users."

    "prompt": "You are simulating an elderly user with low vision and declining visual acuity. This person struggles with small font sizes, low color contrast, dense content, and poor spacing. They may zoom in to read, use a magnifier, or have trouble tracking elements.\n\nEvaluate:\n- Text readability (size, contrast, spacing)\n- Link and button visibility\n- Zoom behavior (does layout break?)\n- Visual clarity and clutter\n\nProvide feedback on how readable and usable the page is for someone with reduced visual perception."

They may use assistive devices like sip-and-puff or single-switch input.\n\nAssess the experience based on:\n- Tab order consistency\n- Presence of visible focus indicators\n- Availability of skip links\n- Whether all interactive elements (forms, menus, modals) are accessible by keyboard\n- Any keyboard traps or broken tab loops\n\nReport on how frustrating or seamless the experience would be for a keyboard-only user."
