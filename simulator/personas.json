Pay special attention to:
- Page title, landmarks, heading structure
- Missing or non-descriptive alt text on images
- Buttons or links without labels
- Dynamic content that may not be announced
- Reading order and tab sequence

Highlight the biggest frustrations and recommend improvements to make this experience smoother for screen reader users."""

Evaluate:
- Text readability (size, contrast, spacing)
- Link and button visibility
- Zoom behavior (does layout break?)
- Visual clarity and clutter

Assess the experience based on:
- Tab order consistency
- Presence of visible focus indicators
- Availability of skip links
- Whether all interactive elements (forms, menus, modals) are accessible by keyboard
- Any keyboard traps or broken tab loops

Report on how frustrating or seamless the experience would be for a keyboard-only user."""
